Import the module
from utility.mongodb import mongoDB
Insert test data into mongo database
In order to insert data, it is necessary to have the json files in the directory ./component-tests/mongo_data/

# Create a dictionary with the collection names as keys and the json file names
# as values.
data_dict = {
    "cars": "cars.json",
    "bikes": "bikes.json"
}
 
# Create a MongoDatabase object
client = mongoDB.MongoDatabase(
    mongo_client_URI = "mongodb://your_database:port",
    mongo_database = "vehicles",
    mongo_data_dict = data_dict
)
 
# Call insert_mongo_data
client.insert_mongo_data()
Fetch data
# Create a dictionary with the query. Field name as key and data as value
query = {
    "id": 3
}
 
# Call fetch_data_with_field
document = client.fetch_data_with_field(
    collection_name = "bikes",
    query = query
)
Work with collections
# Get a collection
cars = client.get_collection_by_name("cars")
 
# Print the contents of the collection
client.print_collection(cars)
 
# This line is equivalent
client.print_collection_by_name("cars")
 
# Fetch a document
vehicle = client.get_document_by_id(
    collection = cars,
    document_id = 5
    )
 
# Delete the document
client.delete_from_collection(
    collection = cars,
    document_id = 5
)
